FACTUALITY RULES:
SOURCE_POLICY:
  TIERS:
    - PRIMARY: eyewitness accounts, official records, inscriptions, charters, archival documents, archaeological reports.
    - SECONDARY: peer-reviewed monographs/articles by domain historians; critical editions with commentary.
    - TERTIARY: encyclopedias, textbooks, general-audience summaries (PROHIBITED in "Sources Used").
  MIN_PER_EPISODE:
    PRIMARY: ≥1 when extant; otherwise justify absence in "Confidence Note".
    SECONDARY: ≥3 from ≥2 independent authors/publishers.
  RECENCY_RULE: Prefer the most recent critical editions and scholarship; when using classic works, specify edition/year.
  DIVERSITY_RULE: Avoid >50% of sources from the same author or series per episode.
  WEB_SOURCES: Allowed only if scholarly (institutional repositories, JSTOR, academic presses). Include archival URL and Accessed YYYY-MM-DD.
  FORBIDDEN: Wikipedia, Quora, blogs without editorial review, AI-generated texts.

HISTORIOGRAPHY HANDLING:
  - When consensus is absent, present the 2–3 leading scholarly positions in separate MSPs with symmetrical phrasing.
  - Include a 1–2 sentence "Dispute Note" per episode summarizing scope (methods, datasets, key works).
  - Do NOT arbitrate; do NOT average numbers. Attribute each claim explicitly ("per Author, Year").

CHRONOLOGY STANDARDS:
  - Dates pre-1900: specify calendar system on first use (Julian/Gregorian; O.S./N.S.), and provide conversion where relevant.
  - Use ISO 8601 for all absolute dates; specify time zones only when relevant to the event.
  - Reign years/era systems: provide crosswalk to CE/BCE on first mention.

TERMS & NAMES:
  - Define key terms (e.g., "state", "empire", "nation") per cited scholarship to avoid anachronism.
  - Use stable transliteration standards; for contested endonyms, state chosen convention once per series.

MSP RULES EXTENDED:
  - Each MSP is ONE verifiable claim (no conjunctions like "and/while"; split if needed).
  - Use precise datelines: [mm:ss] [YYYY-MM-DD] if date known; otherwise [ca. YYYY] with "ca." label.
  - Name standardization: use ISO romanization/ALA-LC; provide endonym [exonym] on first mention.
  - Toponyms: give historical name + present-day country in parentheses on first occurrence.
  - Quantifications: provide ranges and source criteria (e.g., "battle casualties (estimate range 5–7k, excludes disease)").
  - Avoid evaluative adjectives unless directly quoted and cited.

QUANT DATA POLICY:
  - Provide measurement units as in source + metric conversion in parentheses.
  - For population/economic figures, include census/year and coverage definition.
  - For casualties/troop strengths, give range and uncertainty label (High/Med/Low).

- NO_DIALOGUE: {{FACTUALITY.NO_DIALOGUE}}
- NO_SPECULATION: {{FACTUALITY.NO_SPECULATION}}
- CONSENSUS_ONLY: {{FACTUALITY.CONSENSUS_ONLY}}
- NOTE_DISPUTES_BRIEFLY: {{FACTUALITY.NOTE_DISPUTES_BRIEFLY}}
- DO NOT MERGE CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS.
- OMIT UNCERTAIN DETAILS AND AVOID MODERN REINTERPRETATIONS.

MARKERS:
- BEGIN: {{MARKERS.BEGIN_TEMPLATE}}
- END: {{MARKERS.END_TEMPLATE}}
- BULLET: {{MARKERS.BULLET}}

OUTPUT CONTRACT:
- Wrap everything between the correct BEGIN/END markers with {LANG}.
- Provide:
  - Series Title:
  - Series Context: ({{SERIES_CONTEXT_SENTENCES.min}}–{{SERIES_CONTEXT_SENTENCES.max}} sentences)
  - Episodes: N (within EPISODE_COUNT_RANGE if auto)
- For each Episode (i=1..N):
  - Title:
  - Description: (≤ {{DESCRIPTION_MAX_SENTENCES}} sentences)
  - MSP: (exactly {{MSP_PER_EPISODE}} lines, each ≤ {{MSP_MAX_WORDS}} words, prefixed with "-")
    - [mm:ss] <fact beat>
    - ...
  - Episode Runtime Summary:
    - Segments: list of MSP durations
    - Sum: total runtime (must be {{TOLERANCE_MIN}}–{{TOLERANCE_MAX}} minutes)
  - Viewer Takeaway: (1 factual sentence)
  - Sources Used: ({{SOURCES.PER_EPISODE.min}}–{{SOURCES.PER_EPISODE.max}} items, {{SOURCES.FORMAT}})
  - Sources per MSP:           # Variant A — deterministic mapping of sources to each MSP
      1: [<exact names from "Sources Used">]
      2: [<exact names from "Sources Used">]
      ...
      {{MSP_PER_EPISODE}}: [<exact names from "Sources Used">]
    Rules:
      - Keys are MSP indices 1..{{MSP_PER_EPISODE}} (one line per MSP).
      - Values are non-empty lists of source names.
      - Each name MUST EXACTLY match one item in “Sources Used” (string equality, name-only format).
  - Confidence Note: (1 sentence, note if disputes exist)

QUALITY GATES (self-check before finalizing):
- Ensure episode count valid (auto or fixed).
- Ensure runtime per episode within tolerance.
- Ensure no dialogues, no speculation.
- Ensure correct MSP count and length.
- Ensure correct section markers for {LANG}.
- Ensure plain text, hyphen bullets only.
- Insert a blank line between episodes for readability.
- Ensure “Sources per MSP” exists with exactly {{MSP_PER_EPISODE}} entries (keys 1..{{MSP_PER_EPISODE}}).
- Ensure every name in “Sources per MSP” appears in “Sources Used” (exact match, name-only).
- Ensure each MSP has ≥1 source in “Sources per MSP”.
